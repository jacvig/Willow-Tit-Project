    "text": "Welcome\nThis is my project site for modelling Willow Tit population distribution in the UK.\nThe project consists of a short introduction about the species alongside efforts to model the available data to show encounter rate and relative abundance. The code is openly available from GitHub. It is a work in progress and will be updated and added to as I am able.\nThe aims of this project are three-fold, and all personal. First, I wish to add to the knowledge of Willow Tit populations in the UK using openly available citizen-science data. As one of my favourite species, I am regularly involved in surveying populations and have witnessed a decline in the species locally. My interest and concern have naturally led me to learn more about ecology, conservation, and environmental science, but not having formally studied these fields, this project gives me a way of focusing my interest in a way that is valuable to me. And third, it offers a way to improve my data science and programming skills, neither of which were ever something I thought I would pursue but are becoming more necessary in my work as a data management librarian.\nTo submit fixes or suggest additions, please file an issue on GitHub.",

    "text": "1.1 Background\nWillow Tits are in a singular position of holding the dual-status as being the most recently “discovered” resident bird species in the UK, but also the one most rapidly declining. The species was only recognised in 1897, when it was finally distinguished from the Marsh Tit, and subsequently added to the British List of resident birds in 1900 (Cocker and Mabey 2005). However, it is also the fastest declining resident bird in the UK (Burns and Wotton 2020) its population falling by 86% between 1995-2020 with a greater decline estimated between 88-94% since the 1970s (Lewis and Smith 2009). Since 2002, the Willow Tit has been on the Red List as the highest level of conservation concern.\nMany efforts have been undertaken by charities and volunteers to increase the knowledge and understanding of Willow Tit and aid in their conservation. It is my hope that this project can be a part of this wider effort.",

    "section": "1.2 Why eBird data",
    "text": "1.2 Why eBird data\nThe dataset for this project was taken from eBird, a citizen-science database containing observation data submitted by volunteers. These data record birding events in the form of checklists containing a list of species observed and the number of individuals for each species. Checklists also record the location, date, time, and distance for each event.\nMuch has already been written on the robust nature of eBird data for ecological analysis Strimas-Mackey2020, but the single most important aspect of using eBird data for this project is that it is freely available.\nPrevious research, including the national survey, also used citizen-science data collected by volunteers and submitted through recording systems such as Birdtrack. However, these data are held by the BTO and are not publically available. Therefore, opportunities to make use of this data are limited. Since eBird is a freely available dataset, this makes it a unique and vaulable source of data on Willow Tits.\n\n1.2.1 A note on eBird data\neBird data are released as two tab-separated text files (.txt) called the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) and the Sampling Event Data (SED). These two datasets are released monthly and contain all validated bird sightings in the eBird database at the time of release. Both of the datasets can be downloaded in full or for a specific species, region, and time period using the Custom Download.\nThe two datasets included in the download are:\neBird Basic Dataset (EBD): Observation data. In this dataset, each row represents a sighting of a single species including count and other species-level information:\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the eBird observation data\n\n\nSampling Event Data (SED): Checklist data. Each row corresponds to a checklist (birding event) including date, time, location, and effort:\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the eBird checklist data\n\n\nThree key aspects make eBird checklist data useful for anaysis. The first is the field protocol type where observers specify whether they were “traveling”, “stationary”, or if the event was “incidental” (birding was not their primary activity). This enables a distinction between checklists that cover an area, checklists recorded from a single point, and where birding was the main purpose and those where the observer noticed a specific bird. Second, for checklists with the protocol type “travelling”, the distance and speed are recorded so it is possible to gain a picture of the area covered. And third, the field all species reported allows observers to indicate if all species were recorded, that is, if the checklist is a complete record of species during a birding event. Complete checklists enable the inference of zero-counts for species not reported.\n\n\n\n\nBurns, Eaton, F., and S.

They have a rather large head and nape with a black cap and bib.\nWillow Tits are easily confused with Marsh Tits Poecile palustris, but typically have a larger and messier bib as well as a pale panel on the closed wing.

    "section": "2.2 Habitat and breeding behaviour",
    "text": "2.2 Habitat and breeding behaviour\nWillow Tits in the UK occupy damp habitats with dense scrub including scrubby margins around industrial sites and farmland, and wet woodland. An important element of these habitats is deadwood as Willow Tits excavate nest cavities. They are the UK’s only tit species that does this. Tree species in which nest cavities are commonly found include silver birch, elder, and willow, with alder, hazel, hawthorn, wild cherry, and pine also chosen.\nNesting begins in April. Both female and male excavate a new cavity each year with the site around 1.5 meters from the ground and typically no higher than 2 meters. Willow Tits have nested successfully in stumps with a diameter as small as 5cm, but 10-12cm is generally considered optimum (Pinder and Carr 2021). The entrance hole is small and round with a minimum diameter of 20mm. The cavity is 10-25 cm deep and lined with hair, fur, and some feathers on a base of wood chips, plant fibres, or other small particles such as plant buds (Ferguson-Lees and Leech 2011).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWillow Tit nest cavity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWillow Tit nest site. Installing dead logs has been shown to be a successful solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Images Copryright: J.Vigilanti, 2024\n\n\n\nWillow Tits occupy territories all year round. A study in 2020 (Broughton and Maziarz 2020) found that territory size averaged 13.7 hectares with a mean breeding density of 7.3 pairs per 2km squared. Prior to the breeding season, pairs become highly territorial. They vocalise to establish and defend their territories. This period, typically between late January and April, is the easiest time to survey them.\nClutches consist of 6 -12 eggs which the female will brood for around 14 days (Pinder and Carr 2021). After they hatch, young will remain in the nest for approximately 18 days before fledging, and a further 20 days in their home range. Juveniles will range father to establish their own territories, but research is limited on their dispersal. Second broods can occur, but typically when the first brood failed before the egg laying stage.",

For the species to recover, reversals of habitat loss and reductions in food subsidies to its competitors and predators are required (Wilman 2023).",

A custom download was performed to get a subset of the dataset by specifying the species (Willow Tit - Poecile montanus) for the United Kingdom between 2015 - 2024.

    "text": "3.2 Filtering and processing\nBoth the EBD and SED datasets were then imported to RStudio for further filtering and processing using the R programming language following the guide Best Practices for Using eBird data.\nEach of the datasets were filtered in the same way so that only observation and checklist data between February and April were kept.\nThe study-region (United Kingdom) contains checklists falling in the ocean off the costs. These were removed by creating a 1 km buffer around the study region.\n\n3.2.1 Coordinate reference system\nChecklist locations (latitude and longitude) were converted to points geometries using the EPSG.io coordinate system.\n\n\n3.2.2 Zero-filling\nWhere a species is rare or of particular interest, a sampling bias can be introduced by observers seeking out the species and inflating the numbers. One way to mitigate this bias and ensure a more reliable estimate is to use presence-absence data (Strimas-Mackey 2023), (Guillera-Arroita et al. 2015).\neBird data contains presence-only data. But where absence data is also required, data can be filtered to complete checklists only (where all species present were recorded). In this way absence can be inferred for those checklists that did not record the species. Zero-filling, or a count of 0, was performed on the data.\n\n\n3.2.3 Combining the datasets\nIn the process of zero-filling, the observation and checklist data are combined into a single dataset making the data easier to work with.\n\n\n3.2.4 Data transformation\nSeveral of the variables were transformed to make them more useful for analysis and modeling.\n\nTime was converted to a decimal value between 0 and 24 to give hours since midnight.\nFor stationary checklists, a value of 0 was given for distance.\nA variable for speed was created (distance / time).\nChecklists with an observation count given as X (i.e. species present) was converted to NA so it would be stored as an integer.\nThe date was split into the year and the day of the year.\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Reducing the variation in effort\nThe variation in effort between checklists can make inferences challenging since it is associated with variation in detectability. See sections 2.2 Challenges associated with eBird data, and 2.7.1 Spacial precision in (Strimas-Mackey 2023) for a discussion on these challenges.\nThe effort variation of checklists was reduced following the recommendations of Strimas et.al. Checklists were restricted to: less than or equal to 6 hours duration; 10 km in distance; speeds under 100 kilometers per hour; and 10 or fewer observers.\n\n\n3.2.6 Test-train split\nTo test the predictive performance of the model, a testing dataset was created. The data were randomly split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. The variable type was created to indicate which checklist fell in the test or train category.\n\n\n3.2.7 Removed variables\nA number of redundant variables such as country and county codes were removed.\nOnly variables needed for modeling were kept. These included: checklist_id; observer_id; type; observation_count; species_observed; state_code; locality_id; latitude; longitude; protocol_type; all_species_reported; observation_date; year; day_of_year; hours_of_day; effort_hours; effort_distance_km; effort_speed_kmph; number_observers.\n\n\n3.2.8 Overview of the dataset\nThe final dataset contains 269,775 observations where each observation corresponds to a checklist with either a detection or non-detection of Willow Tit.\n\n\n\n\nGuillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta, José J.

    "text": "4.1 Willow Tit Observations\nA preliminary look at the data may be helpful in gleaning a few insights. Here, some exploratory visualisations are presented covering the observations and checklists alongside some discussion.\nA map of the observations was made using GIS data (see the file GISdata.R for the code). Each point on the map corresponds to the latitude and longitude point for a checklist or observation. Checklists with no observations are plotted in grey while checklists with observations of Willow Tits are in green.\nFigure 4.1\nFrom this map, it is clear that there is a spacial bias of checklists across the UK, e.g. a greater number of checklists are recorded around areas such as London while other areas have no checklists.\nIt does show that Willow Tit sightings from the last ten years (2014-2023) are clustered predominately in northern England across the counties of Durham, North Yorkshire, Manchester, and Derbyshire. Sightings across south Wales are also evident. The picture corresponds with the data released from the study organised by the RSPB, and this map gives a more detailed picture of where additional sightings have been recorded across the time period.\nHowever, there are still gaps where no observations exist. This study aims to fill these by using relationships between species occurrence and environmental variables to predict the distribution of Willow Tits in areas that are not sampled. But before any predictions are made, it would be useful to explore the data a bit further.\nMaps were then created for each year to see if anything could be learned from these. Only the first two years (2014 and 2015) and last two years (2022 and 2023) are given:\nLooking at the two first and two last years of the time period, it appears that Willow Tit sightings have increased. However, this is not due to an increased population.\nOne possibility for the increase in sightings might be a taxonomic bias, that is, the preferential recording of a species. It could be the case that observers are actively looking for Willow Tits due to preference for the species or an increased awareness of their decline.\nAnother possibility for increased sightings could be due to eBird growing in popularity with birders. The combination of a user-friendly design and the ability to find locations and identify birds anywhere in the world has made eBird one of the foremost resources for birders. Alongside this, the development of apps such as Merlin, and the ability to easily make lists, has encouraged many new people to get involved. This was particularly noted during 2020-2021 when Covid 19 regulations meant that people stayed at home. With more time on their hands and the emphasis on the importance of getting outside daily, many people took up birding and recorded sightings in real time.\nAn increase in the number of observers and records would naturally increase sightings of rare and beloved species. By restricting the data to complete checklists only will help to mitigate this bias.",

The detection frequency was also plotted. The recommendation to plot only hours for which at least 100 checklists were present was followed since estimates of detection frequency are unreliable when only a small number of checklists are available (Strimas-Mackey 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3\n\n\n\nThe first graph shows that the greatest number of checklists were recorded in the morning. The number drops off as the day progresses but there are still a high number of checklists throughout the day.\nLooking at frequency of detection, it appears that Willow Tit observations begin in the early morning and are steady until the afternoon when they fall off. This is consistent with the behaviour of many small birds in the UK that are typically more active in the morning.\nHowever, it is important to note that the highest detection frequency is still only around 0.6% or 0.7%. Considering the dataset is of an optimal sample size i.e. the number of checklists is high at 269,775, this low detection seems likely and aligns with the declining status of Willow Tits.\nIt may also be concluded that the time of day does not play a significant role in Willow Tit detection. Therefore, restricting checklists to the period when Willow Tits are most vocal, and therefor more likely to be detected (February - April), will be more useful in further predictions than the hour of the day.\n\n\n4.2.2 Checklist duration\nThe data were plotted to show the duration of the checklists; remember that checklists over 6 hours were removed to reduce variability.\n\n\n\nFrom the first graph, it is clear that the greatest number of checklists are under an hour. The detection frequency shows that the longer the birding event, the more likely a Willow Tit observation will occur. This is consistent with what one might expect. However, as with the time of day, the frequency of observations is still low (no higher than 1.5%). There also seems to be a saturation effect where birding events over a given length produce little additional benefit.\nAs with the time of day, duration may not play a significant role in detection of Willow Tits for predictive analysis.\n\n\n4.2.3 Distance travelled\nThe data were plotted to explore the distance travelled; remember that checklists over 10km were removed.\n\n\n\nThe majority of checklists were under 1km which means that these checklists cover a small area. This means that habitat will not be as varied and will enable better predictions based on landcover.\nAs would be expected, detection frequency is greater for checklists with longer distances i.e. the greater the distance traveled, the more likely a Willow Tit will be seen. But again, detection frequency is still low at no higher than 2%.\nDistance, therefore, is of importance for further analysis in that the majority of checklists cover smaller areas and can more reliably stand for the environmental variables they represent.\n\n\n4.2.4 Number of observers\nFinally, the number of observers were plotted having already removed checklists with more than 10 individuals.\n\n\n\nThe majority of checklists were completed by a single individual, with a considerable number of checklists having two observers. It does appear that detection frequency increases with more observers, but there is no real pattern to support this conclusion. This is likely due to so few checklists having three or more observers.Therefore, the number of observers will not be useful in further predictions.\n\n\n\n\nStrimas-Mackey, Hochachka, M. 2023. “Best Practices for Using eBird Data.” Ithica, New York: Cornell Lab of Ornithology. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3620739.",

    "text": "5.1 Landcover\nThis project wanted to look at associations between Willow Tit occurrence and environmental variables to see if any relationships were identified that could then be used as predictors of distribution in areas that were not sampled. Such an approach would potentially help identify sites that could be managed for Willow Tits.\nHowever, it is worth noting that my knowledge of, and experience with, species distribution models is very limited. Therefore, I have relied heavily on Strimas-Mackey (2023) for guidance and recommendations in applying these methods to the data. As well, the following sections have been undertaken more as a means of teaching myself species distribution modeling using a case study, and so the results may not reflect a robust methodology for Willow Tit data analysis.\nThe full R code is available from GitHub. First, MODIS files were downloaded and processed into a raster file (see Processing_MODIS_files.R on ), then the variables were matched to the checklist locations and a prediction grid was created (EnvironmentalVariables.R).\nThe MODIS MCD12Q1 v061 product was the chosen dataset for landcover variables as it provides global coverage at 500m spacial resolution from 2001-present. The University of Maryland classification system was used.

    "section": "1.2 The Data",
    "text": "1.2 The Data\nThe dataset for this project was taken from eBird, a citizen-science database containing observation data submitted by volunteers. These data record birding events in the form of checklists containing a list of species observed and the number of individuals for each species. Checklists also record the location, date, time, and distance for each event.\n\n1.2.1 Why eBird data\nMuch has already been written on the robust nature of eBird data for ecological analysis Strimas-Mackey2020, but the single most important aspect of using eBird data for this project is that it is freely available.\nPrevious research, including the national survey, also used citizen-science data collected by volunteers and submitted through recording systems such as Birdtrack. However, these data are held by the BTO and are not publically available. Therefore, opportunities to make use of this data are limited. Since eBird is a freely available dataset, this makes it a unique and vaulable source of data on Willow Tits.\n\n\n1.2.2 A note on eBird data\neBird data are released as two tab-separated text files (.txt) called the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) and the Sampling Event Data (SED). These two datasets are released monthly and contain all validated bird sightings in the eBird database at the time of release. Both of the datasets can be downloaded in full or for a specific species, region, and time period using the Custom Download.\nThe two datasets included in the download are:\neBird Basic Dataset (EBD): Observation data. In this dataset, each row represents a sighting of a single species including count and other species-level information:\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the eBird observation data\n\n\nSampling Event Data (SED): Checklist data. Each row corresponds to a checklist (birding event) including date, time, location, and effort:\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the eBird checklist data\n\n\nThree key aspects make eBird checklist data useful for anaysis. The first is the field protocol type where observers specify whether they were “traveling”, “stationary”, or if the event was “incidental” (birding was not their primary activity). This enables a distinction between checklists that cover an area, checklists recorded from a single point, and where birding was the main purpose and those where the observer noticed a specific bird. Second, for checklists with the protocol type “travelling”, the distance and speed are recorded so it is possible to gain a picture of the area covered. And third, the field all species reported allows observers to indicate if all species were recorded, that is, if the checklist is a complete record of species during a birding event. Complete checklists enable the inference of zero-counts for species not reported.\n\n\n1.2.3 BTO Breeding Bird Survey data\nAs of December 3, 2024, the BTO released a publically available dataset from their Breeding Bird Survey (Ornithology 2024). This data cover a thirty-year period (1994-2023) and contain the data collected during the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) of the United Kingdom. BBS data are collected twice a year during the breeding season (March - August) for all species that breed in the UK.\nThe release of these data is exciting as, until now, access has been limited thereby restricting analysis to only authorised individuals. It will be important to include these data in the overall project, not least as a benchmark corroborating the validity of eBird data even if collected through a different methodology. They have, therefore, been included as a separate section set alongside the original study.\n\n\n\n\nBurns, Eaton, F., and S.

    "text": "6.1 Assessment of model\nAs stated in the previously, I am still getting to grips with the theory and application of species distribution models. The eBird Willow Tit data is an excellent resource to learn how such models work using real-world data. However, many of the decisions and parameters of the model may not be the most suitable for UK Willow Tit data. I am still learning how best to approach this. I am also happy for any insight. So please feel free to submit suggestions or comments on GitHub.\nThe encounter rate will measure the probability of an observer detecting a species during a standard birding session. In this case, it will be an eBird checklist. Ultimately, it is occupancy (the probability a species occurs at a site) that is most useful, but this is hard to measure with citizen-science data due to the variation in detectability. To address this, it can be useful to include effort covariates in the model so that the encounter rate is proportional to occupancy. Since Willow Tits in the UK are harder to detect, the encounter rate will be substantially lower than the occupancy rate.\nThe model developed by Strimas-Mackey (2023) addresses class imbalance and spacial bias through spatial subsampling. A balanced random forest model is then trained and calibrated before using it to predict encounter rates across the study area and mapping these. The calibration model is trained by predicting the encounter rate for each checklist in the training set, then fitting a binomial Generalized Additive Model (GAM) with the real observed encounter rate as the response and the predicted encounter rate as the predictor variable. The full R code is available in the file EncounterRate.R on GitHub.\nBefore the random forest model was calibrated and run, the data were subsamplled to address spatial bias, temporal bias, and class imbalance (see Ch 3 Methodology). A grid of 3 km by 3 km square was made across the study region, then detections and non-detections were subsampled independently from the grid to ensure not too many detections were lost. To address temporal bias, one detection and one non-detection checklist were sampled from each grid cell for each week of each year.\nAfter running the calibrated random forest model, a set of predictive performance metrics were used to assess the model by comparing the predictions to the actual observations. The following PPMs resulted:\nname\nvalue\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nmse\n0.007\nmean squared error\n\n\nsensitivity\n0.498\nNA\n\n\nspecificity\n0.989\nNA\n\n\npr_auc\n0.152\nprecision recall AUC\n\n\nmcc\n0.367\nmean squared contingency coefficient\n\n\nf1\n0.360\nF score\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Assessment of the calibrated random forest model",

The top variable is an effort variable, which is to be expected since Willow Tits are harder to detect than more common species, so the more time spent, the more likely one would observe a Willow Tit.\nEffort is then followed by environmental variables which, perhaps, support the research that habitat is a vital factor for Willow Tits, that is, they require more specialised habitat than other common species. The model shows that elevation plays a role followed by 10-30% tree cover, both as part of a landscape’s edge and area. These fit well with what is known: that Willow Tits tend to be observed along edges such as scrub lines, and in areas of forest where there are lower canopies dominated by pioneer species (such as Birch) which tend to be smaller or less dense.\n\n\n6.2.2 Partial dependence\nThis estimates the marginal effect of one predictor holding all other predictors constant. These are calculated by predicting encounter rate at a regular sequence of points across the full range of values of a given predictor. Partial dependence has been calculated for the top six predictors.\n\n\n\nPartial dependence\n\n\nEach graph shows the encounter rate (along the y-axis) for each predictor. These results seem consistent with what is known about the species, e.g. Willow Tits tend to be found at lower elevations, along edges, and where the landscape has a percentage of tree cover between 10-30%. There is also some suggestion that Willow Tits are found along the edges of urban areas.",

I have chosen to alter the suggested checklist guide of 2km at 1 hour travelling at peak time of day to better reflect the increased probability of effort, that is, spending longer birding. Therefore, I have chosen to use 2km at 2 hours traveling at peak time of day.\nThe peak time of day was found alongside partial dependence:\n\n\n\nTime of day with highest detectability probability\n\n\nThe first graph is the same as one created earlier in Chapter 2 and shows that the greatest number of checklists occur between 8:00-10:00. The second graph shows the encounter rate across the day. The first and last values were trimmed to maximise the encounter rate and avoid extrapolation. Based on this calculation, the peak time of day for detecting Willow Tits is 6.866 i.e. 6:51.\nThis time was then added to the effort variables (2km, 2 hours) to make predictions for the middle of the focal window of the latest year: 16 March 2023.\nRange estimates were then made across the entire study area and mapped:\n\n\n\nPredicted range of Willow Tit for March 2023 if performing a 2km checklist at 2 hours.\n\n\nThis map shows the expected range where Willow Tits would be encountered in March if birding across a 2km area for 2 hours.

Be aware that this is probably lower than occupancy rate (probability a species occurs at a site), but having applied effort and environmental variables, it is hoped that they are proportionate. Still, considering the decline of Willow Tits, the likelihood of detecting a species is still low.",

    "text": "7.1 A quick note on BBS methodology\nIn December 2024, the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) released their Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) dataset (https://zenodo.org/records/14161736) containing data collected between 1994 - 2023.\nAs an addendum to this project, I analysed the BBS Willow Tit data. It is important to note that BBS collection methodology, as well as the data collected, are very different from eBird. BBS use a standard protocol which attempts to reduce biases as well as quality check data at the point of collection. Therefore, the data preparation and analysis with R cannot be fully comparable to those from the eBird analysis.\nI chose to explore all 30 years of the available data and to see what insights I could glean about Willow Tits. One reason for this is that eBird is a relatively new dataset, having been launched in 2002. Although users are adding their historical checklists, these data are not always complete or can be included, meaning a study covering a longer period of time is not always possible. This is why it can be useful to see both these datasets as part of the bigger picture.\nData collected as part of the BBS follows a strict protocol. A 1x1km grid square is surveyed. Two visits are performed during the breeding season: an early visit, between April and mid May, and a late visit, between mid May and June. For each visit, observers record the number of individuals along two 1km transects. Each transect is subdivided into 200m-long sections and observations are recorded at four distance bands: &lt;25m, 25-100m, &gt;100m, in flight at a distance.\nSee the accompanying BBS paper https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13943 for more detailed methodology and discussion.",

    "text": "7.3 Willow Tits in the North West\nAccording the the Lancashire Wildlife Trust, more than 15% of the UK’s Willow Tits are found in the North West. Over the past few years, the Trust has been running their Wet Willow Wildlife project aimed at improving habitats across Greater Manchester and the surrounding areas. The project is currently ongoing and the data are not publically available. I thought it would be interesting to plot both the BTO and eBird data on the area surrounding Manchester to see the results. Note, I used all the BBS data available as there were fewer data points.\n \nAgain, this was an interesting exercise. The eBird data added to the picture already in place, but it also revealed that many of the observations occur on rivers and water features where habitat is idea for Willow Tits. The picture also shows that these waterways may function as corridors allowing Willow Tits to move and establish new territories.",
