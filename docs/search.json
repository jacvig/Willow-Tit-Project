    "text": "1.1 Background\nWillow Tits are in a singular position of holding the dual-status as being the most recently “discovered” resident bird species in the UK, but also the one most rapidly declining. The species was only recognised in 1897, when it was finally distinguished from the Marsh Tit, and subsequently added to the British List of resident birds in 1900 (Cocker & Mabey, 2005). However, it is also the fastest declining resident bird in the UK (Burns, et al. 2020, p.14) its population falling by 86% between 1995-2020 with a greater decline estimated between 88-94% since the 1970s [LEWIS 2009]. Since 2002, the Willow Tit has been on the Red List as the highest level of conservation concern.\nMany efforts have been undertaken by charities and volunteers to increase the knowledge and understanding of Willow Tita and aid in their conservation. It is my hope that this project can be a part of this wider effort.",

    "section": "1.2 Why eBird data",
    "text": "1.2 Why eBird data\nThe dataset for this project was taken from eBird, a citizen-science database containing observation data submitted by volunteers. These data record birding events in the form of checklists containing a list of species observed and the number of individuals for each species. Checklists also record the location, date, time, and distance for each event.\nMuch has already been written on the robust nature of eBird data for ecological analysis Strimas-Mackey2020, but the single most important aspect of using eBird data for this project is that it is freely available.\nPrevious research, including the national survey, also used citizen-science data collected by volunteers and submitted through recording systems such as Birdtrack. However, these data are held by the BTO and are not publically available. Therefore, opportunities to make use of this data are limited. Since eBird is a freely available dataset, this makes it a unique and vaulable source of data on Willow Tits.\n\n1.2.1 A note on eBird data\neBird data are released as two tab-separated text files (.txt) called the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) and the Sampling Event Data (SED). These two datasets are released monthly and contain all validated bird sightings in the eBird database at the time of release. Both of the datasets can be downloaded in full or for a specific species, region, and time period using the Custom Download.\nThe two datasets included in the download are:\neBird Basic Dataset (EBD): Observation data. In this dataset, each row represents a sighting of a single species including count and other species-level information:\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the eBird observation data\n\n\nSampling Event Data (SED): Checklist data. Each row corresponds to a checklist (birding event) including date, time, location, and effort:\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the eBird checklist data\n\n\nThree key aspects make eBird checklist data useful for anaysis. The first is the field protocol type where observers specify whether they were “traveling”, “stationary”, or if the event was “incidental” (birding was not their primary activity). This enables a distinction between checklists that cover an area, checklists recorded from a single point, and where birding was the main purpose and those where the observer noticed a specific bird. Second, for checklists with the protocol type “travelling”, the distance and speed are recorded so it is possible to gain a picture of the area covered. And third, the field all species reported allows observers to indicate if all species were recorded, that is, if the checklist is a complete record of species during a birding event. Complete checklists enable the inference of zero-counts for species not reported.",

    "text": "2.1 Habitat and breeding behaviour\nWillow Tits occupy damp habitats with dense scrub including scrubby margins around industrial sites and farmland, and wet woodland. An important element of these habitats is deadwood as Willow Tits excavate nest cavities. They are the UK’s only tit species that does this. Tree species in which nest cavities are commonly found include silver birch, elder, and willow, with alder, hazel, hawthorn, wild cherry, and pine also chosen.\nNesting begins in April. Both female and male excavate a new cavity each year with the site around 1.5 meters from the ground and typically no higher than 2 meters. Willow Tits have nested successfully in stumps with a diameter as small as 5cm, but 10-12cm is generally considered optimum (Pinder & Carr, nd). The entrance hole is small and round with a minimum diameter of 20mm. The cavity is 10-25 cm deep and lined with hair, fur, and some feathers on a base of wood chips, plant fibres, or other small particles such as plant buds (Ferguson-Lees, et al. 2011).\nWillow Tits occupy territories all year round. A study in 2020 (Broughton et.al) found that territory size averaged 13.7 hectares with a mean breeding density of 7.3 pairs per 2km squared. Prior to the breeding season, pairs become highly territorial. The vocalise to establish and defend their territories. This period, typically between late January and April is the easiest time to survey them.\nBroods consists of 6 -12 eggs which the female will brood for around 14 days (Pinder & Carr, nd). After they hatch, young will remain in the nest for approximately 18 days before fledging, and a further 20 days in their home range. Juveniles will range father to establish their own territories, but research is limited on their dispersal. Second broods can occur, but typically when the first brood failed before the egg laying stage.",

    "text": "3.2 Filtering and processing\nBoth the EBD and SED datasets were then imported for further filtering and processing using the R programming language following the guide Best Practices for Using eBird data (Strimas, et. al. 2023).\nEach of the datasets were filtered in the same way so that only observations/checklists between February and April were kept.\nThe study-region (United Kingdom) contains checklists falling in the ocean off the costs. These were removed by creating a 1 km buffer around the study region.\n\n3.2.1 Coordinate reference system\nChecklist locations (latitude and longitude) were converted to points geometries using the EPSG.io coordinate system.\n\n\n3.2.2 Zero-filling\neBird data contains presence only data, but with complete checklists (checklists where all species present were recorded) absence can be inferred and a count of 0 can be given for those species. Having presence/absence data is important for analysis especially in the case of rare species or species of particular interest. This is because observers may seek these birds out thereby inflating the numbers.\n\n\n3.2.3 Combining the datasets\nIn the process of zero-filling, the observation and checklist data are combined into a single dataset making the data easier to work with.\n\n\n3.2.4 Data transformation\nSeveral of the variables were transformed to make them more useful for analysis and modeling.\n\nTime was converted to a decimal value between 0 and 24 to give hours since midnight\nFor stationary checklists, a value of 0 was given for distance\nA variable for speed was created (distance / time)\nChecklists with an observation count given as X (i.e. species present) was converted to NA so it would be stored as an integer.\nThe date was split into the year and the day of the year\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Reducing the variation in effort\nThe variation in effort between checklists can make inferences challenging since it is associated with variation in detectability (see section 2.2 Challenges associated with eBird data and section 2.7.1 Spacial precision in Strimas et.al. for a discussion on these challenges). The effort variation of checklists was reduced based on the recommendations of Strimas et.al. Checklists were restricted to less than 6 hours duration, 10 km in distance, speeds below 100 km/hr, and with 10 or fewer observers.\n\n\n3.2.6 Test-train split\nTo test the predictive performance of the model, a testing dataset was created. The data were randomly split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. A type variable was created to indicate which checklist fell in the test or train category.\n\n\n3.2.7 Removed variables\nA number of redundant variables such as country and county codes were removed. Only variables needed for modeling were kept. These included: checklist_id, observer_id, type, observation_count, species_observed, state_code, locality_id, latitude, longitude, protocol_type, all_species_reported, observation_date, year, day_of_year, hours_of_day, effort_hours, effort_distance_km, effort_speed_kmph, number_observers.\n\n\n3.2.8 Overview of the dataset\nThe final dataset contains 269,775 observations where each observation corresponds to a checklist with either a detection or non-detection of Willow Tit.",
