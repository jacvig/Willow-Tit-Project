abstract = {Abstract Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to inform a range of ecological, biogeographical and conservation applications. However, users often underestimate the strong links between data type, model output and suitability for end-use. We synthesize current knowledge and provide a simple framework that summarizes how interactions between data type and the sampling process (i.e. imperfect detection and sampling bias) determine the quantity that is estimated by a SDM. We then draw upon the published literature and simulations to illustrate and evaluate the information needs of the most common ecological, biogeographical and conservation applications of SDM outputs. We find that, while predictions of models fitted to the most commonly available observational data (presence records) suffice for some applications, others require estimates of occurrence probabilities, which are unattainable without reliable absence records. Our literature review and simulations reveal that, while converting continuous SDM outputs into categories of assumed presence or absence is common practice, it is seldom clearly justified by the application's objective and it usually degrades inference. Matching SDMs to the needs of particular applications is critical to avoid poor scientific inference and management outcomes. This paper aims to help modellers and users assess whether their intended SDM outputs are indeed fit for purpose.},

abstract = {Monitoring data from the British Trust for Ornithology document a decline in United Kingdom (UK) Willow Tit (Poecile montanus kleinschmidti) abundance that has been abrupt enough to be characterized by a catastrophe theoretic model. The reasons for the decline are thought to be some combination of increased nest competition and predation by the beneficiaries of a bird-feeder food subsidy, and habitat loss. A statistically estimated predator-prey catastrophe model is useful in illustrating how habitat loss and species interactions could combine to cause a precipitous population decline, and showing that, if the UK Willow Tit population is to recover, it will likely require both reversals of habitat loss and reductions in food subsidies to its competitors and predators. To achieve the latter, humans may have to collectively introduce rules that reduce the private enjoyment of backyard bird feeding to preserve broader ecological integrity.}
